## 🌟 What is Journal Buddy?

> **Journal Buddy** is a private, offline AI that chats with you about your day and transforms it into a beautifully written **Obsidian journal entry** — in *your own voice*.

No blank pages.
No typing fatigue.
No cloud.
Just **talk → journal → saved.**

---

## 🧠 Why this exists

Most journaling apps expect you to **write perfectly every day**.
Real life doesn’t work like that.

Journal Buddy lets you **think out loud** — the AI organizes your thoughts into a polished journal entry.

It feels like texting a friend who turns your life into literature ✨

🙂 You: Kinda awkward today...

🧠 Bot: What happened?

🙂 You: I ran into my crush at college 😭

🧠 Bot: Oh nooo — tell me more.

...

🙂 You: That’s all for today

🧠 Bot: ✨ Writing your journal...
